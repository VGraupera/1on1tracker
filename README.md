One-on-one tracking app for managers and their direct reports written in React and Firebase
built and designed for the mobile web.

Instead of continuing to use paper, or forgetting things, I wanted an
app to keep track of my one-on-ones, plus I wanted to learn more about React and Firebase,
so I created this.

A *live* version can be found at [https://www.1on1tracker.com](https://www.1on1tracker.com)
