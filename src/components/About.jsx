      <h1>About 1on1tracker.com</h1>
      <p>1on1tracker is a web application to keep track of 1 on 1 meetings between managers and the people that report to them (aka "direct reports", or "directs"). It also includes a list of directs that can be grouped by teams, sample questions to ask at 1 on 1 meetings, and follow up items.</p>
      <p>It's been designed for mobile web because I wanted to use it on my phone. I don't like taking notes on paper that can get lost, and using a laptop is IMHO not so great for 1 on 1 meetings.</p>
      <p>There are some commercial applications that deal with 1 on 1 meetings. My approach was to create something simple for myself and share it with other managers. This app was designed by me, Vidal Graupera and engineering manager in the SF Bay Area, and I use this application myself.</p>
